/**
 * Doomsday Clock (anti-stall). Once armed, every side must hold a rising
 * share of the whole map: each player in FFA, each whole team in team modes (so
 * a team is judged on its combined territory and every member shares the fate).
 * The bar rises in discrete waves (battle-royale zone), stepping up to each
 * wave's level (chosen by the speed preset, see DoomsdayClock.ts) and holding. As
 * it rises the bottom is cut, which forces consolidation and guarantees a finish.
 *
 * A side below the bar is marked (inDoomsdayClock -> blinking skull on the client)
 * and, after the warn window, every member bleeds an escalating percentage of
 * their troops (and warship health) until the side recovers or reaches the floor
 * (drainFloorPercent of each max). The drain cripples, it does not wipe: a doomed
 * side settles at 5% of max, not zero, so a brief dip below the bar is
 * recoverable. Climbing back above the bar clears the mark and stops the drain;
 * the rising bar still forces a finish by squeezing territory.
 *
 * Deterministic: integer-only. The threshold is one floored integer ratio (see
 * DoomsdayClock.ts) and the drain a floored percentage, no floating-point. Off
 * unless enabled in the GameConfig. Runs once per second (every 10 ticks), like
 * WinCheckExecution.
